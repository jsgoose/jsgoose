- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsgoose
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, data, weather, cybersecurity, and sustainability. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use things like github, basics of python, and good study habits.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, but I'm ready to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me - by email if you know me already.
